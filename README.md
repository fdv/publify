## What is this?

The marketing blog application for the Money Advice Service.

## What's Publify?

We forked the blogging engine - Publify for purposes of the MAS Marketing Blog.

The feeling was that we would diverge far enough that tracking/merging upstream would be an issue.

Publify has been around since 2004 and is the oldest Ruby on Rails open source project alive.

## How do I run it?

### Installation

#### Prerequisites

Ruby 2.1.3

This repository comes equipped with a self-setup script:

```bash
$ ./bin/setup
$ rails s
```

You'll need to set the environment keys this repo requires in `.env`. If you're a MAS dev, you can grab these over at the [company wiki](https://moneyadviceserviceuk.atlassian.net/wiki/display/DEV/Marketing+Blog+Repo+Credentials).

#### Testing

```bash
$bundle exec rspec
```

Run with `COVERAGE=true` in your test environment to report on coverage.
